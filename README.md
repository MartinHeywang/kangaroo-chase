# Kangaroo chase

> This simulator is currently under development.

This repo contains the code for a math problem simulator. It involves a "kangaroo chase" where one kangaroo chases the other, jumping across the real line or the real plan (the problem can be both uni-dimensional or bi-dimensional).

For more details, on the problem, download & read [subject.pdf](./subject.pdf) (only available in french).
